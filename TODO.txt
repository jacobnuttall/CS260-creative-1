To do:

1) Welcome page
2) Game page
3) Styling (What color scheme, should we make color scheme changeable, etc.?)
3) Code for tetris blocks/canvas/etc.
4) Code for recognizing keyboard commands
5) Animations
6) Music?

These are some things I thought of in an order that might be good
for development, lmk what you think.
